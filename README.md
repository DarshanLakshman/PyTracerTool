# PyTracerTool Module

Welcome to the PyTracerTool Module! This module provides a versatile tool, PyTracerTool, for tracing the execution of Python code, capturing variable changes, and logging print statements. PyTracerTool helps you gain insights into the sequence of code execution, variable values, and output generated during runtime.

## Features

* Trace the execution order of Python code.
* Capture variable changes during code execution.
* Log print statements and associate them with line numbers.
* Generate a formatted trace table for analysis.

## Installation

You can install PyTracerTool via pip:

```bash
pip install pytracertool
```

## Website

Please have a look at a website I developed, which takes Python code as an input and allows you to step through the program - https://tracetableproject.pythonanywhere.com/
